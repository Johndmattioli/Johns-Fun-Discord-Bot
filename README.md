# Johns-Fun-Discord-Bot

- In this repository, I have included a sample Discord Bot that I've been playing around with
- Majority of the logic lies in message create function. There are a few functions nested there...

**Command List**

  1. get the news titles - Makes a REST HTTP Call to Nexushub API, collects the news titles, and returns back to the client.
  2. hey bot suck my ass - Returns the client a message, proxying your name back to you so that you feel really bad about offending the bot.
  3. how many times does egan dab each day? - Returns the client a numeric value of how many dabs our friend Connor Egan takes per day.
  4. !select - Will return a sample select box component to the client
  5. *default case* - Anything else will include a message incidating that your request could not be processed including your username.
